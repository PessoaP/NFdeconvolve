# NFdeconvolve

**NFdeconvolve** is a tool designed for deconvolution tasks using normalizing flows.

## Getting Started

### Tutorials
To get started with **NFdeconvolve**, explore the examples provided in the `tutorial.ipynb`. This notebook demonstrates the key functionalities of the package.

### Performance Testing
The performance of **NFdeconvolve** has been evaluated in our manuscript:  
*"Avoiding subtraction and division of stochastic signals using normalizing flows: NFdeconvolve"*  
You can access the preprint as soon as it becomes available on arXiv (Scheduled Jan 16).

To reproduce the figures presented in the manuscript, navigate to the `paper_examples` directory and run the following `bash.rc`.

### Other libraries
NFdeconvolve is based upon the normfloes library found [here](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows)
